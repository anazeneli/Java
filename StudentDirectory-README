Student Directory Project
This project implements a system which lists students and their academic programs. 
Each program has its required course list and each student has a list of his/her courses taken. 
Each course has a course name, number, and/or grade. 
The application is to use a menu to answer several questions such as a particular student 
information and his/her courses taken, student gpa, a course average, students registered in one program, etc. 
The project presents this menu in terminal or via GUI windows.
